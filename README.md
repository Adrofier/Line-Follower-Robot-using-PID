# Line-Follower-Robot-using-PID
Line Following Robot with the help of Arduino and the code was based on PID Control System. The robot was fully autonomous and didn't require any manual control. The sensors used was an array of short range IR sensors used to detect the line which the robot needs to follow. Extreme cases where there is overlapping of the line and sharp turns are also covered in the code.
